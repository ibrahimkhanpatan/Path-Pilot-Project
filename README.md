# Path-Pilot-Project
This project involves designing and building an autonomous robot capable of line-following and object-avoidance. It utilizes an Arduino Uno microcontroller along with IR sensors, an ultrasonic sensor, a motor driver module, and motors.
The main objectives are to create a robot that can accurately follow a black line on a white surface by controlling its movement based on IR sensor readings, and incorporate object avoidance by using an ultrasonic sensor to detect and navigate around obstacles.
The project explores fundamental line-following and object-avoidance principles, sensor technologies, motor control, and programming logic. It highlights the integration of various components like microcontrollers, sensors, and actuators to achieve autonomous navigation.
The results show the successful construction and operation of the robot, demonstrating its ability to follow a black line accurately and adjust its trajectory to avoid obstacles detected by the ultrasonic sensor.
